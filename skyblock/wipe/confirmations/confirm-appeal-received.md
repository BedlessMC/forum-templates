Hello,

We've received your SkyBlock account wipe appeal and queued it. We will treat it as soon as possible.

You will receive a reply to this Forum Thread with our response, whether your appeal is granted or denied, or if we require further information from you (in the case your appeal is incomplete).

If you want to add something to this appeal, please send it under this message, with what you want to add, and we'll update your current appeal. Do not send a new one - we close older appeals upon receiving new ones and our response will be pushed back if you do.
